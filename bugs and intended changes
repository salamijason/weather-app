_fixed bug_

**selected solution**

### _changing country while in fahrenheit leads to api sending info in celsius_

in which the user can again 'change to celsius' producing wrong temp.

- maybe reset to celsius everytime country is changed?
- **or change unit that api gets info**
  convert shift in seconds to hours, mins
  if shift in hours is great enough, convert change in day

### time changes that match up with city

- **reformat all dates based on utc and do conversions**
  hour and minutes have been fixed but not day. for example: early morning on tuesday in a country is late night monday in another.
- depending on inputted country, change date.now to date.(whatever country)

### inaccurate starting page (currently just placeholders)

### clean up code with functions
