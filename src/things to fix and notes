_fixed bug_

**selected solution**

### _changing country while in fahrenheit leads to api sending info in celsius_

in which the user can again 'change to celsius' producing wrong temp.

- maybe reset to celsius everytime country is changed?
- **or change unit that api gets info**

### time changes that match up with city

- reformat all dates based on utc and do conversions
- depending on inputted country, change date.now to date.(whatever country)
